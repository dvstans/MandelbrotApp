# MandelbrotApp
This project is a Qt-based Mandelbrot Set generator that was created primarily as a technology demonstration. This application is able to take advantage of modern multi-core CPUs allowing it to generate large and/or high quality Mandelbrot set images relatively quickly. The application also includes features for creating and applying complex custom color palettes that can produce beautiful and intricate rendered images. Several example images created by this application and the author are included in the /images folder.

The /source folder contains a Qt 6.8 application project file (MandelbrotApp.pro) and all source files. As Qt is cross-platform, the application can be built for Windows, Linux, and OS/X operating system. Building the application will require installing Qt 6.8 as well as whichever build kits are needed for your platform.

For help on using MandelbrotApp, please refer to the [manual.md](./manual.md) file.
